Hello! My name is Trent. I am an Electrical Engineering student at FIU in Miami, FL and I currently live in Broward County, FL. Right now, I work as a Patent Engineer at a local patent law firm. I am interesting in sharpening my programming skills and learning new techniques. Thanks for toppping by!
